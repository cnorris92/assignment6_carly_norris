## Introduction

This reports analyzes the differences in female lizard length between two species (Colorado Checkered Lizard (CNTE) and Desert Grassland Lizard (CNTE)). Basic summary statistics and data visualization are first conducted, then the Welch's two-sample t-test was then conducted to check for a significant difference between mean lengths. Differences between groups are described by Cohenâ€™s d effect size. 

Data used for comparisons was taken from a study conducted near the San Andreas National Wildlife Refuge and White Sands National Park in New Mexico from 1989-2006. Lizards were collected in live traps (Lightfoot, 2017).

**Figure 1**: A box plot visualizes data dispersion and lizard length differences between Colorado Checkered Lizards and Desert Grassland Lizards. Box endpoints indicate the 25^th^ and 75^th^ percentile values and whiskers indicate minimum and maximum values. The medians are represented by the black line.

### Conclusions

On average, female Colorado Checkered Lizards (CNTE) are longer than female Desert Grassland lizards (CNUN) (`r round(lizards_summary[1,2],2)` $\pm$ `r round(lizards_summary[1,4], 2)` and `r round(lizards_summary[2,2],2)` $\pm$ `r round(lizards_summary[2,4], 2)` mm, respectively; mean $\pm$ 1 standard deviation). The absolute difference in means between female CNUN and CNTE lizard lengths is `r round(lizards_summary[1,2]-lizards_summary[2,2])`mm (a `r round((lizards_summary[1,2]-lizards_summary[2,2])/((lizards_summary[1,2]+lizards_summary[2,2])/2)*100,2)`% difference). The difference in means is significant (Welch's two-sample t-test: t (`r round(lizards_ttest$parameter,2)`) = `r round(lizards_ttest$statistic, 2)`, *p* <0.01), and the effect size is large (Cohen's *d* = `r round(lizardseffsize$estimate, 2)`).
